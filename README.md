## My read me file


Please set the working directory to an empty folder of your convenience

Run FIRST the script <b>download_and_subsetting.r</b> ONCE, only one time.


This will download once the zip file from the url: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip
It will uncompress it and then it will load it into R. Later it will filter (subset) the data.

Once this is done, please proceed to run Plot1.r etc.
